# Workflows

This repository contains a collection of workflows created using the [de.STAIR atoms](https://github.com/destairdenbi/galaxy-atoms). These workflows are are incorporated in the [Galaxy workflow generator](https://github.com/destairdenbi/galaxy-workflow-generator)
to provide a baseline of working use-cases, which users can adopt to familiarize with
Galaxy tools for DGEA and RRBS/BS-Seq data analyses.
